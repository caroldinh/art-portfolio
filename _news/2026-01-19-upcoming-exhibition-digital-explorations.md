Hello world! It appears you have found the first post on my new art website. Some things
to share this fine and chilly January: 

## Exhibition news

I am excited to share that I will be part of the upcoming *Digital Explorations* exhibition by 
Maryland Federation of Art at the Circle Gallery in Annapolis! The exhibition will run January 28 - 
February 28, 2026. I will have two pieces on display and for purchase, both of them computational 
digital art pieces made with Processing code.  

Juried by Andy Holtin (American University), *Digital Explorations* is an exhibition of work created 
at least in part by digital tools. From the Maryland Federation of Art exhibition call:

> Computer software and technology have forever expanded the ways artists capture and produce their work. Artists can weave together scenes in photoshop, produce paintings through a screen, create videos, animations, and projections that transport us to new worlds, and sculpt with a 3D printer. Maryland Federation of Art (MFA) invites all artists residing in any of the states or territories of the US, Canada, or Mexico to enter our 4th annual exhibition dedicated to digitally-produced art. Any original 2D or 3D image based work created and/or produced through digital software and following exhibition guidelines will be considered. This includes, but is not limited to digitally produced photography, digital painting, illustration, graphic design, digital video and projection.

The web gallery for the exhibition is already available [online](https://mdfedart-digitaldirections2026.artcall.org/pages/web-gallery){:target="_blank"}.  

Some behind-the-scenes: for one of my pieces, I experimented with printing on tissue paper and I am quite pleased
with the final result. I will be driving out to drop off the physical artworks in Annapolis sometime this week, while keeping an eye on the upcoming snowstorm forecast to figure out a wise time to be on the road...

## Personal musings

This is something I've been going back and forth about for ages, something I initially refused to do, 
and something I am now biting the bullet on: I have decided to separate my art and technical portfolio 
websites. 

While I was still a student pursuing an interdisciplinary media design and computer science 
degree, it made sense to have all of my work in one place. But right now, I'm working in software
development for a scientific product. Outside of school, it's very rare that people who look me up to 
see my creative work are interested in what I do as my day job and vice versa. 
Last year, I applied for an art show at a convention and the organizing team got back to me confused about 
what kind of artwork I would be displaying, since my portfolio included non-tangible, non-visual software 
things.  

This year, I'm trying to get my visual art and creative writing out in the world a bit more, and 
I'd like to be able to just share one repository of relevant work without making people sift through 
confusing field-specific categories. It's hard to categorize my work as a multidisciplinary artist, and 
of course I'll have works that fit into both the technical and artistic categories (see this website's 
entire "Computational" section), but I'm laying out this general guideline:  

1. If it's something I want to show full-time employers or academic panels, it goes into my technical portfolio.  
2. If it's something I want to show galleries, exhibition jurors, or fellow creatives, it goes into my artistic portfolio.  

## Keeping in touch  

This news feed is mostly for my own record, to document my creative work. I can't say how often I will update 
this site, but I will update it when - say - I get accepted into an event or exhibition, which could be every 
couple weeks (unlikely), every couple months (ambitious), or a couple times per year.  

I no longer use "image gallery" or short-form video social media platforms, so I may also use this news feed 
as a place to post sketches and works-in-progress. The best ways to stay in touch will remain:  

1. Through private channels, if you know me IRL;
2. Through email, caroldinh [at] tuta [dot] io;
3. Through my BlueSky account, [@urlocalcyb.org](https://bsky.app/profile/urlocalcyb.org){:target="_blank"}  
4. Adding this blog's feed to your preferred RSS feed app: [https://urlocalcyb.org/feed/news.xml](https://urlocalcyb.org/feed/news.xml){:target="_blank"}

That's pretty much it for my first post. I have a lot of goals for this year, art-wise, but first of
all, portfolios to prepare and emails to send; hopefully, by the end of the year, I'll be able 
to look back at this feed to see what I've been able to make happen.   

Cheers,
