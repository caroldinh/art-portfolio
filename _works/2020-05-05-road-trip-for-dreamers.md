alt: "Two people sit on top of a green sedan pulled up to a viewing point by a waterful under the moonlight. One of the figures is a young man with a green hoodie and the other is a young woman with a NASA sweatshirt, her jeans rolled up, clutching her shoes by the shoestrings in her hand. Both are turned contemplatively in opposite directions, neither watching the waterfall."
